# SunPosition
For Earth, computes solar declination, radius vector, equation of time, and sun angles on horizontal or sloping surfaces.
Uses the MATLAB datetime data type so the user does not have to worry about conversions between local times and UTC.
Examples are provided as MATLAB Live Functions, which can be run and in which code can be examined.

Code is best installed via download from the MATLAB File Exchange:
